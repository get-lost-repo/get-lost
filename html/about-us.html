            <p>Avid camper since age 2, he is always looking for that perfect spot to set up camp.
                Jon prefers the forest areas to the beach or mountains.  He is not afraid of a hike and you will
                probably find him trying to catch a glimpse of the local wild life.  He is a Software Developer in his spare time.

            <p class="morton">Prefering to avoid crowds, Chris might be found roaming the mountainsides; never afraid of going
                the extra mile and sometimes enjoying long walks on the beach at sunset. He might appear to be stargazing but probably
                he is thinking about what is next for this site or maybe looking for Orion. He is a Software Developer in his spare time.

            <p class="carranza">He was once told "There are three things a person can do without ceasing, watch fire, watch the ocean
                and watch other people work", hopefully you will find him doing at least two of the three somewhere on the olympic
                peninsula; if you find him, please do not feed him. He is a Software Developer in his spare time.
