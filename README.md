# Get Lost

## Problem Domain

Roughly 3600 square miles of Washington State, the Olympic Peninusla inlcudes such natural beatuies as the Olympic Mountains, spectacular coastal beaches, hot springs, and the Hoh Rainforest. However, we were unable to find a great resource that would allow someone to easily find a base camp, suited to their personal preferences, that would allow them to discover and enjoy all that this amazing place has to offer. So we decided to build one. And that is where the idea for 'Get Lost' was born. 


## User Stories

As an avid camper, I want to be able to discover new campsites so that I can enjoy all the Olympic Peninsula has to offer.  

As a user, I want to be able to search for specific campground amenities so that I can tailor the search results to my desired experience. 

As a user, I want to be able to read comments from previous campers so that I will get the most up to date information on campsites that have been recently visited.
